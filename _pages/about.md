I am physicist who focuses on developing hardware and instrumentation for far-infrared through microwave missions. I am an Assistant Research Scientist at Center for Space Sciences and Technology (CSST) at The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). 

My work with UMBC is primariy within the Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science & Technology II (CRESST II) cooperative agreement between the CRESST II consortium and NASAâ€™s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

I also enjoy outreach and science communication and sharing my love for science with everyone.
