I am physicist who focuses on developing hardware and instrumentation for far-infrared through microwave missions. I am an Assistant Research Scientist at [Center for Space Sciences and Technology (CSST)](https://csst.umbc.edu/) at The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC). My background is in building cosmic microwave background (CMB) instruments and I enjoy working with hardware and developing next generation space technology to let us study the universe.  

My work with UMBC is primariy within the [Center for Research and Exploration in Space Science & Technology II (CRESST II)](https://cresst2.umd.edu/) cooperative agreement between the CRESST II consortium and NASAâ€™s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).

I did my PhD in physics at Brown Unviersity with Prof. Greg Tucker, working mostly on the E and B Experiment (EBEX), a balloon-borne CMB polarimeter. I then continued my early research career at GSFC as a [NASA Postdoctoral Program (NPP)](https://npp.orau.org/) Fellow with Dr. Ed Wollack, continuing to work on CMB Detectors with the [Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS)](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/) series of telescopes. 

I also enjoy outreach and science communication and sharing my love for science with everyone.
