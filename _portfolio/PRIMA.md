title: "The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA)"
---
The Astro2020 Decadal Survey recommended a new line of astrophysics mission intermediate in scale between MIDEXs and Flagship-class observatories. In response, NASA created the Astrophysics Probe Explorer class and solicited proposals for the first generation of Probes. With a larger cost cap, Probes can achieve more ambitious science than SMEXs or MIDEXs and be implemented faster than Flagships â€“ as frequently as one per decade. PRIMA is one of two Probe concepts selected by NASA for a study in 2024/2025, potentially leading to implementation and launch in 2032.
