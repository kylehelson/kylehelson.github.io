title: "The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA)"
---
PRIMA is one of two Probe concepts selected by NASA for a study in 2024/2025, potentially leading to implementation and launch in 2032. PRIMA is a far-infrared space telescope designed to meet a whole suite of science demands from the far-infrared community. PRIMA's two instruments, the Far-Infrared Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS), and a multi-band spectrophotometric imager / polarimeter, the PRIMA Imager (PRIMAger) use background limited microwave kinetic inductance detectors (mKIDs) cooled to 100 mK. PRIMA will cover 25 - 250 microns in both instruments. 

PRIMA is lead by NASA GSFC Astrophysicist Dr. Jason Glenn but is an international collaboration including JPL and many other research universities.
