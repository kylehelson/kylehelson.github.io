about: "Low reflectivity, cryogenically compatible, polymer-based filters."

Diamond-loaded polyimide aerogel filters reject high frequency infrared light by scattering the light away from the optical path. The desired low frequency light is passed by the filter. These filters are designed to be used in systems that observer from ~10 GHz up to above 10 THz. 

The filters are low emissivity and have cutoff frequencies that can be tuned via the adding different amounts of specific sizes of diamond particles. 

These filters are a collaboration between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and NASA Glenn Research Center.
