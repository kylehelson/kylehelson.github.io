about: "A balloon-borne hot-Jupiter phase curve spectrograph from 1-4 microns"

---
EXCITE is a NASA-funded 0.5 meter balloon-borne telescope designed to phase-resolved spectroscopy of hot-Jupiter exoplanets from 1-4 microns. Taking advantage of the NASA long-duration balloon program, EXCITE will fly for several weeks from the Antarctic and observe exoplanets with orbital periods of a few days. 

EXCITE will be the first dedicated near-IR phase curve instrument, measuring a frequency band that is unavailable from the ground or airborne observatories. Because phase curves often require substantial telescope time, only a handful of them have been measured by Hubble, Warm Spitzer, and JWST. One three-week long science flight from EXCITE could double or triple the number of full hot Jupiter phase curves. 

EXCITE leverages a flight-spare JWST NIRSpec H2RG and MACIE readout electronics from RST. EXCITE builds heavily upon the gondola and attitude control system from the SuperBIT series of flights. 

EXCITE is a collaboration between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Brown University, Arizona State University, La Sapienza Universita di Roma, StarSpec Technologies, Oxford University, Cornell University, and University College London.
