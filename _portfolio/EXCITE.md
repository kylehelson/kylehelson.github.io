EXCITE is a NASA-funded 0.5 meter balloon-borne telescope designed to phase-resolved spectroscopy of hot-Jupiter exoplanets from 1-4 microns. Taking advantage of the NASA long-duration balloon program, EXCITE will fly for several weeks from the Antarctic and observe exoplanets with orbital periods of a few days. 

Here is a video of the EXCITE engineering flight launch: https://youtu.be/gyccHyHTNWM
