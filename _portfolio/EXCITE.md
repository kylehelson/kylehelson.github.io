EXCITE is a balloon-borne instrument that will measure spectroscopic phase curves of hot Jupiter-type exoplanets. Phase curve measurements can be used to characterize an exoplanet's atmospheric composition and energy circulation patterns. EXCITE carries a 0.5 m primary mirror and moderate resolution diffraction-limited spectrograph with spectral coverage from 0.8 - 3.5 microns. EXCITE is designed to fly on a long-duration balloon (LDB) mission from Antarctica. EXCITE will observe through the peak of a target's spectral energy distribution (SED) and through spectral signatures of hydrogen and carbon-containing molecules. 

EXCITE will be the first dedicated near-IR phase curve instrument, measuring a frequency band that is unavailable from the ground or airborne observatories. Because phase curves often require substantial telescope time, only a handful of them have been measured by Hubble, Warm Spitzer, and JWST. One three-week long science flight from EXCITE could double or triple the number of full hot Jupiter phase curves to date. 

EXCITE leverages a flight-spare JWST NIRSpec H2RG and MACIE readout electronics from RST. EXCITE builds heavily upon the gondola and attitude control system from the SuperBIT series of flights. 

EXCITE is a collaboration between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Brown University, Arizona State University, La Sapienza Universita di Roma, StarSpec Technologies, Oxford University, Cornell University, and University College London. 

EXCITE successfully completed an engineering flight on August 31, 2024.
